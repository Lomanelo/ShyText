ShyText is a location-based messaging app that allows users within a 10-meter radius to send messages to each other without needing to be friends. The recipient receives an instant notification and can accept or decline the conversation. If accepted, the chat can continue even after moving beyond the 10-meter range.

🚀 Features

Location-Based Messaging: Users can message others nearby without prior connections.

Instant Notifications: Receive a real-time alert when someone sends you a message.

Privacy-Focused: Users have the option to accept or refuse conversations.

Persistent Chats: Conversations remain available after moving out of the initial 10-meter range.

🛠️ Tech Stack
